		Hi! I'm Mallory, a Junior studying User Experience/User Interface Design and Research in the School of Information at the University of Michigan. I am a firm believer in collaboration and communication. Being a problem solver and a quick thinker makes it easy for me to adapt to a multitude of different work environments. I am enthusiastic and self-motivated and my inquisitive mind is always exploring ways to improve my projects. I am interested in Human-Computer Interaction, product design, and web design. In my career, I want to explore how these fields assimilate in and apply to our ever-changing society.

		I grew up in a suburb of New York City on the north shore of Long Island. I have been working since I was 15 years old; this has instilled a work ethic in me that is very unique. I am passionate about my hometown, Michigan Football, my dog, and New York pizza.

		In my free time, I like to seek out new foods and restaurants, hang out with friends, go to the beach, or choose a new TV show to binge watch. My interests include animals, college sports, travel, running, and yoga. I like to live a life full of new adventures and new ideas. I always have my eye on the next challenge. I hope to continue this lifestyle in my career and throughout my life.
